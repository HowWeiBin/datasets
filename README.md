# datasets

This contains the eigenenergies and structures of 104 diamond structures. Each structure has two atoms in the unit cell and is taken from the dataset of Bartok et al (https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.041048), using the same calculation setup as Ben Mahmoud et al. (https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.102.235130)
